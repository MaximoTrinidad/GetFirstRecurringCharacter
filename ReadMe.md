# Exercise
Create a powershell function or cmdlet that takes an arbitrarily long string parameter $foo (e.g. 'abcdedcba') and returns the first recurring character in that Input string.
In 'abcdedcba', 'd' would be the first recurring character, so the cmdlet/function should return 'd' for that sample input.


# Notebook Samples
Check out both *PowerShell one-liners and function sample code with their results saved on the existing Notebooks folders:
1. ../GetFirstRecurringCharacter/OneLinerScript
2. ../GetFirstRecurringCharacter/FunctionScript

Also, I inclued two updated onli-liners file and the function to automically detect recurring character in a string:
1. */GetFirstRecurringCharacter/OneLinerScript/Sample_Oneliners_FindRecurringCharacter.*
2. */GetFirstRecurringCharacter/FunctionScript/Function_Get-RecurringCharacter.*

*note: PowerShell kernel doesn't exist in Binder.
